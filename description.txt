The code is divided to 2 parts: 
1. test bleu similarity in train and dev
2. predict test from train and dev

# Data Cleaning
1. text to str.lower
2. standardize signs like """ to ''', Who s to who is
3. remove greetings
4. change words like AI NLP to full name
In fact, I tried skills like lemma and stopword, but it just doesn't work well.

# Track 1
1. Representation: combination different kinds of TF-IDF
2. Similarity: Cosine Similarity of the above representations. 
Choose the highest one.

# Track 2
1. Representation: combination of doc2vec and fasttext
2. similarity: Cosine Similarity like Track 1.

# Track 3
1. model = SentenceTransformer("BAAI/bge-large-en")
2. faiss similarity
